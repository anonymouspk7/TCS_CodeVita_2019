For enhancing the book reading, school distributed story books to students as part of the Childrenâ€™s day celebrations.

To increase the reading habit, the class teacher decided to exchange the books every weeks so that everyone will have a different book to read. She wants to know how many possible exchanges are possible.

B2 B1 B4 B3

B2 B3 B4 B1

B2 B4 B1 B3

B3 B1 B4 B2

B3 B4 B1 B2

B3 B4 B2 B1

B4 B1 B2 B3

B4 B3 B1 B2

B4 B3 B2 B1
